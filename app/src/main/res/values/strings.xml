        <h1>Game Rules:</h1>
        <p>"Bulls and cows" is a logic game in which one of the players should guess what number the other player chosen in a few attempts.
        In our game we are going to guess a four-digit number. The digits in this number should not be repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first player calls a guess, any four-digit number. If there are digits that stand on the same positions as
        in the hidden number, these are bulls. If the numbers are the same, but they are in different positions, they are cows.
        For example, the hidden number <b>1234</b>. The player calls <b>1256</b>. These are 2 bulls and 0 cows. If the player calls <b>3456</b> these are 2 cows and 0 bulls.

        There are helper buttons at the top of the game interface. The first click on the button turns it red, the second click turns it blue, and the
        third click restores defaults.
        This way you can mark the numbers that are exactly in the hidden number and numbers that are exactly not there.

        In the interface of easy and hard levels, there are buttons for entering your number.
        At the easy level, entering of digits is mandatory, you can\'t change it after entering. On difficult level input is at will. The digits can be changed at any time, by simply taping on it.
        Entering a number just helps you not get confused and correctly enter the quantity of bulls and cows. The description of difficulty of levels is below in this guide.

        <p><b>Our game has 3 levels of difficulty.</b></p>
        <p>
        <b>The first level</b> is <i>training</i>. Your task is to guess what number the AI chosen in 10 attempts.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>The second level</b> is <i>easy</i>. At the beginning, you think a number and enter it in a special field. If the number is correct
        (all digits in it are different), the game begins. You try to guess first what number the AI has chosen.
        You do not need to enter a response to the assumption AI, the program enter a  bulls and cows of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here you can think, and what prevents AI to take my hidden number, and just output it.
        Next level is specially added for such players.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>The third level</b> is <i>difficult</i>.
        You keep a hidden number in your head, or you can enter it in a special field, but this is completely optional. You enter bulls and cows
        by your own in response to the AI assumption. But remember, if you make a mistake or cheat, AI will understand it, and the game will ends.
        </p>
        <p>
        Choose the level of difficulty that you like and beat the AI. And remember that human intelligence is still stronger. Or maybe not?
